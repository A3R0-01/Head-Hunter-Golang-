# Head Hunter (in-progress)
- a site for both job recruiters and job seekers. Jobs are posted and can be applied to by the corresponding job seekers. This api is designed specifically to give the recruiters free reign on the matter. Only the recruiters are capable of posting, and jobs only. the only form of contact allowed on the site is between recruiter and job seeker.

## Updates coming soon
